## Developer Relations (DevRel)

Developer Relations is the discipline of building **two-way, mutually-beneficial relationships** between companies that create developer-facing technology (APIs, SDKs, frameworks, platforms) and the developers who use—or might use—it. 
Modern DevRel blends elements of product, engineering, marketing, community, and education to help developers succeed while helping the business reach its goals.


## Origins

| Era | Milestone | Why It Mattered |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|
| **Early 1980s** | **Apple** creates the *Software Evangelist* program. Mike Boich & later Guy Kawasaki recruit developers for the Macintosh. | Widely credited as the first modern DevRel effort. |
| **1997** | **Microsoft Developer Relations Group** launches to court ISVs and track Windows app growth. | Shows DevRel at enterprise scale and cements the practice in mainstream tech. |
| **Mid-2000s** | Web 2.0/API-first companies (Twilio, SendGrid, Stripe, etc.) brand themselves “developer-first.” | DevRel evolves from lone evangelists to multifunction teams (docs, DX, community). |
| **2015 → present** | Dedicated events (*DevRelCon*), books (*The Business Value of Developer Relations*), and annual surveys appear. | DevRel becomes a recognised career path with its own metrics and frameworks. |
