## Optimizing Your LinkedIn Profile

### 1. Profile Photo
Use a clear, friendly photo. Smile. No logos, no distractions.

### 2. Banner Image
Add a banner that shows what you do or something related to DevRel (e.g., speaking at a conference, your blog logo).

### 3. Headline
Avoid “Unemployed DevRel Enthusiast.”  
Use something like:  
`Developer Advocate | Writing @ DevStuff | Speaker | Helping Devs Build in Public`

### 4. About Section
Tell your story:  
- What do you do?  
- What do you care about?  
- What value do you bring?

**Example:**  
I’m a Developer Advocate focused on helping engineers build better tools and grow their careers. I create content, speak at events, and build community around open source. Let’s connect and build cool stuff together.

### 5. Experience
Add relevant DevRel, community, or content experience.  
Mention:  
- Talks given  
- Blog posts written  
- Projects contributed to
