title: Purpose of this Guide
---

The purpose of this guide is to serve as a **collaborative, evolving resource** 
that captures the principles, practices, and experiences of Developer Relations (DevRel) professionals. 
Created by the **DXMentorship community**, it is designed to support both aspiring and seasoned
DevRel professionals by offering practical and first hand insights, frameworks, and strategies grounded in
real world context.

This guide aims to:

- **Demystify DevRel** by clearly defining its scope, goals, and impact within tech organizations.
- **Standardize knowledge** across the DevRel space, helping newcomers onboard faster and practitioners scale their efforts more effectively.
- **Highlight best practices** in areas such as community building, developer experience (DX), content creation, product advocacy, feedback loops, and more.
- **Encourage diverse contributions**, ensuring that different voices and perspectives are reflected, especially from underrepresented regions or industries.
- **Provide a portfolio-worthy project** for contributors—showcasing collaborative work that blends writing, research, and thought leadership in Developer Relations.

By documenting what works (and what doesn’t), this guide becomes a valuable tool not only for individual learning but also for teams, hiring managers, and organizations looking to strengthen their developer-facing efforts.
