# DevRel Resume Structure

A clear, purposeful structure helps hiring managers quickly see your value. Here’s a recommended format tailored for DevRel roles.

> **Note**: Aim for a concise, one-page resume. If you need a second page to showcase proof of work and examples, that’s perfectly fine just keep both pages clear and relevant.

### 1. Header

- Name  
- Contact info (email, GitHub, LinkedIn, website/blog)

### 2. Summary or Objective (2–3 lines)

A short paragraph that answers:  
> *Why are you a great fit for DevRel?*

Example:  
> Developer Advocate focused on open-source tools, with a passion for simplifying complex technologies through content and community engagement.

### 3. Experience

Even if not traditional DevRel roles, highlight:

- Teaching, mentoring, or tutoring  
- Creating technical tutorials or documentation  
- Speaking at meetups or contributing to communities  

Focus on impact, communication, and how you support other developers—not just what you’ve built.

### 4. Skills

List both **technical** and **DevRel-relevant** skills:

- **Technical**: JavaScript, APIs, Docker, Git, etc.  
- **DevRel**: Content creation, community building, public speaking, documentation, developer onboarding

### 5. Featured Work / Proof of Work

Use this as your mini portfolio:

- Link to 2–3 strong examples: blog posts, video tutorials, conference talks, GitHub repos  
- Show product understanding and your ability to explain concepts  
- Make each item scannable and link-rich  

> This is your chance to show—not just tell—your ability to do DevRel work.

### 6. Community Contributions

- Developer ambassador programs  
- Open source contributions  
- Community organizing or volunteering  
- Learning cohorts or hackathons

### 7. Education (Optional)

- Degrees, certifications, bootcamps  
- Self-taught courses that show initiative and drive
