# Create Winning DevRel Resumes

A DevRel resume isn't just a list of jobs. It's a narrative of how you communicate, build, and grow communities using technical products.

Here's how to make yours stand out even without formal experience.

## Start Simple & Minimal

- Keep it clean, minimal, and easy to read.
- Your **goal is clarity**, not clever design.
- Make sure your top section answers: *Why should someone be excited to talk to you?*

> Less is more — clarity wins.

## Focus on the Product

- Show that you understand what the product does.
- Even better: **demonstrate that you've used it**.
- Talk about your experiences with the product in your resume, cover letter, or portfolio.

> Using a product well is one thing; explaining it to others is DevRel.

This helps you demonstrate genuine interest and practical familiarity.

### Stand Out with Proof of Work

One of the most effective ways to get noticed — especially if you don't have formal experience — is to create **Proof of Work tailored to the company you're applying to**.

Instead of just saying *"I love your product"*, **show it**:

- Create a **video tutorial**, **demo**, or **article** using their product.
- Share it on platforms like [Dev.to](https://dev.to), [Hashnode](http://hashnode.com/), your blog, or YouTube.
- Mention it in your application or resume and include a link.

> **Example**: A candidate applying to Appwrite created a video tutorial on how to implement authentication using their SDK and published an article explaining their newly released Model Context Protocol(MCP). This demonstrated both familiarity with the product and the ability to explain technical concepts clearly — essential skills in DevRel.

This kind of effort **sets you apart** from hundreds of applicants with similar resumes. It tells the team: *"I'm already doing the work — imagine what I can do if you hire me."*

### Show Community Involvement

- Add past **volunteer** work, **ambassador** roles, **cohort** participation, and community contributions.
- These show initiative and your willingness to grow through others.
- DevRel is about **people and communication** as much as it's about code.

DevRel thrives on empathy, communication, and service — show that you've already been doing this in your own way.

## Land DevRel Roles Without Experience - No Experience? No Problem

If you're early in your career, focus on these:

- Volunteer with communities.
- Join ambassador programs or open source cohorts.
- Start a blog or video series explaining tech concepts.
- Learn in public: build and share consistently.
- Track your metrics — even small wins count.

> **What matters**: how often you write, what kind of content you create, and how you research & explore topics.

## Build a Writing Routine

Questions to answer on your resume or in interviews:
- How often do you write content?
- What kind of content do you create (blog, docs, video, etc)?
- How do you research and find content topics?

This gives insight into your thought process and consistency.

## Red Flags on DevRel Resumes

Here's what to avoid:

- Over-relying on AI — similar responses or lack of original voice.
- Including content with **no proof or links**.
- Writing generic summaries with **no depth or ownership**.
- Talking about projects with **no real examples** or metrics.

> Instead, show how you think, what you write, and how you work.
> Always include links to your work: GitHub repos, blog posts, YouTube videos, etc.

## Final Tips

- Add **metrics** where possible—like community growth, content reach, etc.  
- Think like a **product**: you’re not just listing skills, you’re showing value.  
- Stay curious and keep **learning and sharing publicly**.

> **Pro Tip**: Use a public GitHub repo, portfolio site, or Notion page to house your DevRel work examples.
